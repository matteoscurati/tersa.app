# Development

## Prerequisites

- macOS 15 or later, or a current Linux distribution, for shared-core work
- Rust 1.91.1, installed automatically through `rust-toolchain.toml`
- Xcode 26 for Apple application work beginning in M0 PR3

The supported release targets are arm64 macOS 15 or later and iOS/iPadOS 18 or
later. Linux is a continuous-integration target for the platform-independent
core, not a product distribution target.

## Baseline verification

Run the complete local Rust suite with:

```sh
cargo xtask verify
```

This command checks dependency boundaries, formatting, compilation, Clippy,
tests, and documentation. CI additionally runs dependency licensing and
advisory checks, feature-powerset checks, DCO validation, and spelling checks.

## Dependency changes

Use intentional dependency declarations in the workspace manifest. Do not use
wildcard versions or add a dependency speculatively. A pull request that
changes `Cargo.lock` must explain why the dependency is needed, its license,
and any relevant security or binary-size impact.

See [Dependency rules](architecture/dependency-rules.md) before adding a new
crate or changing an internal edge.
