//! The production token-broker composition (ADR-0024).
//!
//! [`BrokerCore`] wires the portable OAuth and token state machines to the
//! injected transport, refresh-token store, clocks, and entropy ports. It owns
//! the full lifecycle — begin/complete authorization, refresh, provider
//! revoke, and local delete — under the crate's security invariants: strict
//! literal-IPv4 loopback redirects with an explicit ephemeral port, an
//! atomically claimed bounded session registry, per-subject single-flight
//! permits released by RAII (a completion claims its account's permit before
//! any store read or write), persistence of any refresh credential BEFORE a
//! success is reported, snapshot-conditional cleanup of stranded
//! post-exchange grants (a provider revoke only ever runs against a
//! definitively empty store snapshot, because Google revocation is
//! grant-wide, and an unreadable snapshot fails closed before any store
//! write or revoke), a fail-safe non-destructive under-scoped completion
//! (nothing persisted, nothing revoked: no validated identity exists to
//! gate a grant-wide revoke), and public values that carry no refresh
//! token, PKCE verifier, state, or authorization code. No mutex guard is
//! held across an `.await`, and no access token is ever cached: every
//! success value is minted fresh from a provider round trip.
