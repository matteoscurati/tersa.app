//! In-process account runtime for tersa (ADR 0031).
//!
//! Composes the token service (`tersa-token-broker-core`), the Gmail REST
//! adapter, the encrypted store and registry, and the identity gate into the
//! account flows: add, sync, and remove. Everything runs in one process; the
//! refresh token lives in the account's encrypted database.
